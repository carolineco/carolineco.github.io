# I’m a UX Researcher and Product Leader with 10 years of experience and an academic background in anthropology.
 
In my career, I’ve:
* built tools for New York Times journalists
* designed systems used by thousands of medical professionals
* grown product and design teams from the ground up
* helped early start-ups clarify their product strategy 
 
I love talking to users, making sense of complexity, and working with collaborative, cross-functional teams.
